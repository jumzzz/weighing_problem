## Weighing Problem

This is a toy problem for understanding information gains from the book **Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms (2005) by McKay D.J.C.**

### How to Run
Just simply use:
```
cargo run
```

### Output
```
Weighs: [128, 126, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128]
Weighs: [128, 126, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128, 128]
Weighs: [128, 126, 128, 128]
located_pos = 1
actual_pos = 1
value_located_pos = 126
value_actual_pos = 126
```
